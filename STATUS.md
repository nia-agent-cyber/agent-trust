## Messaging Pivot Summary

### Key Differentiators vs ERC-8004

| Aspect | ERC-8004 | Agent Trust |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Identity verification | Reputation enforcement |
| **Backing** | Ethereum Foundation, Google, Coinbase | Independent (nimble) |
| **Infrastructure** | New standard (unproven) | EAS (battle-tested, 2.5M+ attestations) |
| **Code status** | Specification | Working SDK + 108 tests |
| **Novel feature** | Registry | Recursive attester scoring |

### Key Messages to Use
- ✅ "ERC-8004 tells you WHO. Agent Trust tells you IF you should trust them."
- ✅ "Identity + Reputation = Agents you can actually trust"
- ✅ "Standards don't create autonomy. Enforcement does." (GoKiteAI quote)
- ✅ "108 tests, not a proposal. We ship working code."
- ✅ "Built on EAS — battle-tested with 2.5M+ attestations"

### Messages to AVOID
- ❌ "Alternative to ERC-8004" (they have insurmountable institutional backing)
- ❌ "The trust layer for agents" (ERC-8004 owns this language now)
- ❌ Any competitive framing — complement, don't compete

## ⚠️ DO NOT ASSUME

- ❌ "PRs not merged" — WRONG, all merged Feb 5
- ❌ "We compete with ERC-8004" — WRONG, we COMPLEMENT them
- ❌ "Trust layer" messaging — WRONG, ERC-8004 owns that term now
- ✅ "ERC-8004 tells you WHO, we tell you IF" — CORRECT positioning

**Always use the new complement positioning, not competitive framing.**
