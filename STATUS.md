## Messaging Pivot Summary

### Key Differentiators vs ERC-8004

| Aspect | ERC-8004 | Agent Trust |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Identity verification | Reputation enforcement |
| **Backing** | Ethereum Foundation, Google, Coinbase | Independent (nimble) |
| **Infrastructure** | New standard (unproven) | EAS (battle-tested, 2.5M+ attestations) |
| **Code status** | Specification | Working SDK + 108 tests |
| **Novel feature** | Registry | Recursive attester scoring |

### Key Messages to Use
- ✅ "ERC-8004 tells you WHO. Agent Trust tells you IF you should trust them."
- ✅ "Identity + Reputation = Agents you can actually trust"
- ✅ "Standards don't create autonomy. Enforcement does." (GoKiteAI quote)
- ✅ "108 tests, not a proposal. We ship working code."
- ✅ "Built on EAS — battle-tested with 2.5M+ attestations"

### Messages to AVOID
- ❌ "Alternative to ERC-8004" (they have insurmountable institutional backing)
- ❌ "The trust layer for agents" (ERC-8004 owns this language now)
- ❌ Any competitive framing — complement, don't compete

## Announcement Plan (Feb 7, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ READY — Launch announcement draft complete

See `LAUNCH_ANNOUNCEMENT.md` for:
- Twitter thread (7 tweets)

**Key message:** "ERC-8004 tells you WHO. We tell you IF you should trust them."

## ⚠️ DO NOT ASSUME

- ❌ "PRs not merged" — WRONG, all merged Feb 5
- ❌ "We compete with ERC-8004" — WRONG, we COMPLEMENT them
- ❌ "Trust layer" messaging — WRONG, ERC-8004 owns that term now
- ✅ "ERC-8004 tells you WHO, we tell you IF" — CORRECT positioning

**Always use the new complement positioning, not competitive framing.**

## Next Steps

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-06 10:37 GMT by Trust BA

### Recommended Priority: 🤝 PARTNER (with tactical Marketing support)

**Rationale:** We have working code (108 tests). Building more features now is premature without user feedback. Launch posts are done—marketing ROI comes from engagement + partnerships, not more posts. Our first real attestations will come from partners, not marketing campaigns.

The @owockibot bounty ($150) and @raven_nft integration request are immediate opportunities with high visibility and validation potential.

### Top 3 Specific Actions

| # | Action | Rationale | Owner |
|---|--------|-----------|-------|
| **1** | **Pursue @owockibot bounty aggressively** | We built what they're RFC'ing. Show working code, claim bounty, get Gitcoin ecosystem visibility. Immediate ROI + validation. | Main |
| **2** | **Respond to @raven_nft TODAY** | Live contract at `0x528DFC...`. They explicitly requested integration. Gives us first real users + attestations. Low-hanging fruit. | Main |
| **3** | **DM Praxis Protocol** | Coordination layer needs trust signals. We complement perfectly: they orchestrate tasks, we verify trustworthiness. Natural partnership. | Main |

### Secondary Actions (Week 1-2)

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Formalize Butterfly Protocol partnership | GenButterfly already proposed; continuity + reputation = full-stack identity |
| Engage @owockibot EAS discussion | Join the "EAS vs ERC-8004" conversation happening now |
| Explore Lobsnet integration | LinkedIn for agents needs verification layer |

### What Success Looks Like

| Metric | Timeline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| @owockibot bounty claimed OR partnership formed | 1 week | ✅ |
| SwampBots integration live | 2 weeks | First "Verified by SwampBots" attestations |
| Praxis Protocol partnership announced | 2 weeks | Joint announcement |
| Real attestations (not genesis) | 30 days | 10+ |
| SDK downloads | 30 days | 50+ |

### Why NOT Build More Features Now

1. **No user feedback yet** — Building features in a vacuum risks building wrong things
2. **SwampBots integration IS the feature** — Real integration > hypothetical features
3. **Trust tiers can wait** — Partners will tell us what they need
4. **@owockibot bounty validates our approach** — Let ecosystem confirm direction before expanding

### Why NOT Heavy Marketing Now

1. **Launch posts are done** — Twitter thread, Molthub, PinchSocial all posted today
2. **Engagement > Posts** — Reply to comments, DM partners, join conversations
3. **Partnerships create organic marketing** — SwampBots announcement > solo posts
4. **Social proof first** — Real attestations + integrations make better marketing content

### Competitive Response Likelihood

| Competitor | Likely Response | Our Counter |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **ERC-8004 ecosystem** | Continue expansion with institutional backing | Complement, don't compete. "WHO vs IF you should trust" |
| **SAID (Solana)** | May expand cross-chain | Stay focused on Base; EAS battle-tested infra |
| **@owockibot RFC** | Could build or partner | Show working code; they may prefer to use vs build |
| **Clawlancer** | Using ERC-8004 on Base | Potential integration partner (add reputation to their identity) |

### Critical Window: 48-72 Hours

Post-launch momentum is fleeting. These actions should happen THIS WEEK:

- [ ] @owockibot — Follow up on bounty reply, offer demo
- [ ] @raven_nft — PinchSocial DM with integration proposal
- [ ] Praxis Protocol — Twitter DM introducing partnership opportunity
- [ ] Monitor launch engagement — Reply to all comments/mentions
- [ ] Track first external SDK installs
