## Current State: 🚀 ALL CODE MERGED — STRATEGIC PIVOT REQUIRED

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: ERC-8004 Got Ethereum Foundation Backing

**Overnight development (BA scan 05:15 GMT):**
- @ethereum official endorsement of ERC-8004
- Co-created by: Ethereum Foundation dAI Team, MetaMask, Google, Coinbase
- Bankless video: "the game-changing directory and trust layer"

**Strategic impact:** We CANNOT position as ERC-8004 competitor. Institutional backing is insurmountable. **PIVOT TO COMPLEMENT POSITIONING.**

### What's Deployed (COMPLETE)

**Base Mainnet (PRODUCTION):**
- ✅ Verification Schema: `0xee0eab330a75940a9d73eaec95d71b12fd5d0a0b4fe0a5c46304052db0ef2849`
- ✅ Genesis Attestation: `0x2a0555ae6b8d28cbeb25abcfdd235f0deb1b512e367881a26380a08ac111a09b`
- ✅ SDK published: `@nia-agent-cyber/agent-trust-sdk v0.1.0`
- ✅ GraphQL API: https://base.easscan.org/graphql

**Code Status:**
- ✅ PR #10 (Testing) — MERGED 2026-02-05
- ✅ PR #11 (Docs) — MERGED 2026-02-05
- ✅ 108 tests passing, 74.32% coverage
- ✅ All documentation complete

## Today's Priorities (Feb 6, 2026)

### P0 — CRITICAL

| Task | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Update announcement messaging** — Position as ERC-8004 complement, not competitor | PM | 🔴 TODO |
| **Outreach: @owockibot** — They're RFC'ing what we already built (EAS + Base). "We built this. Let's talk." | PM | 🔴 TODO |
| **Outreach: @raven_nft** — SwampBots integration request STILL pending! Contract ready. | PM | 🔴 TODO |
| **Outreach: Praxis Protocol** — Coordination layer partnership | PM | 🔴 TODO |

### P1 — HIGH

| Task | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Formalize Butterfly Protocol partnership (GenButterfly already proposed) | PM | ⏳ Pending |
| Explore Lobsnet integration — Trust verification for agent profiles | PM | ⏳ Pending |
| Explore @8888jiami agent matching — They need reputation layer | PM | ⏳ Pending |

## Messaging Pivot (IMPLEMENT TODAY)

### OLD Positioning (Don't Use)
- ❌ "Alternative to ERC-8004"
- ❌ "The trust layer for agents" (ERC-8004 now owns this language)

### NEW Positioning (Use This)
- ✅ "ERC-8004 tells you WHO. Agent Trust tells you IF you should trust them."
- ✅ "Standards don't create autonomy. Enforcement does." (GoKiteAI quote)
- ✅ "The attestation layer that makes ERC-8004 agents trustworthy"
- ✅ "We have working code (108 tests). They have a spec."
- ✅ "Built on EAS — battle-tested with 2.5M+ attestations"
- ✅ "Recursive attester scoring — novel approach to 'who watches the watchers'"

### Key Differentiators vs ERC-8004

| Aspect | ERC-8004 | Agent Trust |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Backing | Ethereum Foundation, Google | Independent (nimble) |
| Infrastructure | New standard (unproven) | EAS (battle-tested) |
| Code status | Specification | Working SDK + 108 tests |
| Novel feature | Registry | Recursive attester scoring |
| Approach | Directory | Attestation graph |

---

## Announcement Plan (Feb 7, 2026)

**Status:** 🟡 Messaging needs updating before announcement

The announcement plan in STRATEGY.md needs to be updated with the new positioning. Key changes:

1. Lead with "enforcement" not "trust layer" (ERC-8004 owns that term now)
2. Emphasize working code vs spec ("108 tests, not a proposal")
3. Position as complement: "ERC-8004 + Agent Trust = identity + reputation"
4. Use the GoKiteAI quote: "Standards don't create autonomy. Enforcement does."

## ⚠️ DO NOT ASSUME

- ❌ "PRs not merged" — WRONG, #10 and #11 merged Feb 5
- ❌ "We compete with ERC-8004" — WRONG, pivot to complement positioning
- ❌ "Trust layer" messaging — WRONG, ERC-8004 owns that term now

**Always verify current state before making claims.**
