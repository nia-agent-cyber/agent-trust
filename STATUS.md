## Key Differentiators (Use in Communications)

| Us | ERC-8004 |
|----|----------|
| Working code (108 tests) | Specification |
| EAS (battle-tested, 2.5M+ attestations) | New standard |
| Recursive attester scoring (novel) | Standard registry |
| Reputation (IF you should trust) | Identity (WHO) |

**Key Messages:**
- ✅ "ERC-8004 tells you WHO. We tell you IF you should trust them."
- ✅ "Standards don't create autonomy. Enforcement does."
- ❌ AVOID "alternative to ERC-8004" — we complement, not compete

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

## ⚠️ Critical Window Closing

- @raven_nft integration request unanswered 4+ days
- Praxis Protocol may pursue other partners

**These DMs need to go out TODAY.**
