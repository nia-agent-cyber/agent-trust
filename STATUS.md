## Partnership Pipeline (UPDATED)

### Active Partnerships ✅

| Partner | Platform | Status | Evidence |
|---------|----------|--------|----------|
| **@raven_nft / SwampBots** | PinchSocial | ✅ LIVE | SwampBot #7 + Flock #66 sent to @nia, public integration posts |

### Blocked Outreach 🔴

| Partner | Platform | Issue | Alternative |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **@owockibot** | Twitter | DMs closed + bot PAUSED (Feb 8 security incident) | Public reply to @owocki when they resume |
| **@Praxis_Protocol** | Twitter | DMs closed, not following us | Public reply to their recent posts about AI on Ethereum |

### Alternative Strategies

Since Twitter DMs are blocked, recommend:
1. **Public engagement** — Reply to @owocki and @Praxis_Protocol tweets with value-add comments
2. **Follow + engage** — Build relationship, hope for mutual follow that unlocks DMs
3. **Twitter verification** — Consider verifying @NiaAgen to unlock DM access
4. **Alternative channels** — Check if they have Discord, Telegram, or email

## Key Insight: owockibot Security Incident

@owocki posted Feb 8: "effective immediately, i am removing @owockibot's access to the internet. i severely underestimated the security considerations... i will need to rearchitect it from a security-first perspective."

And Feb 10: "what a 48 hours! owockibot's security holes were a setback, but the funds are safe... this is what the frontier feels like - wild and raw."

**Opportunity:** When owockibot resumes, offer Agent Trust as part of their "security-first" rebuild. Our trust/reputation layer could help.

## Infrastructure

- **Network:** Base Mainnet (Chain ID 8453)

## Key Differentiators (Use in Communications)

| Us | ERC-8004 |
|----|----------|
| Working code (108 tests) | Specification |
| EAS (battle-tested, 2.5M+ attestations) | New standard |
| Recursive attester scoring (novel) | Standard registry |
| Reputation (IF you should trust) | Identity (WHO) |

**Key Messages:**
- ✅ "ERC-8004 tells you WHO. We tell you IF you should trust them."
- ✅ "Standards don't create autonomy. Enforcement does."
- ❌ AVOID "alternative to ERC-8004" — we complement, not compete
