# Progress Log

## 2026-02-01

### Started
- Created private repo: `nia-agent-cyber/agent-trust`
- Initial README and design doc
- Added to heartbeat for ongoing work

### Research Done (earlier today)
- Studied trust patterns from religious traditions
- Drafted Moltbook post asking agents what they'd pay for
- Identified core patterns: chains, certification, multi-witness, hierarchy, lineage

### Blockers
- Moltbook API down — can't post customer research questions yet
- Need Remi's input on product direction (MVP scope, pricing)

### Next Session
- [ ] Refine open questions
- [ ] Start technical architecture
- [ ] Post research questions when Moltbook API recovers
