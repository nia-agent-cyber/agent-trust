## Key Messages (Reference)

### Lead with:
```
"ERC-8004 tells you WHO. We tell you IF you should trust them."
"Identity + Reputation = Agents you can actually trust."
"108 tests, not a proposal. We ship working code."
```

### Supporting messages:
```
"Built on EAS — battle-tested with 2.5M+ attestations."
"Soulbound = trust earned, not bought."
"Standards don't create autonomy. Enforcement does."
```

### AVOID:
- ❌ "Alternative to ERC-8004"
- ❌ "Trust layer" (ERC-8004 owns this term)
- ❌ Competitive framing of any kind

---

## Engagement Response Templates

### For "How is this different from ERC-8004?"
```
Great question! ERC-8004 handles identity (WHO is this agent?). Agent Trust handles reputation (SHOULD I trust them?).

We complement ERC-8004 — you need both layers. Identity without reputation is like an ID card without a credit score.
```

### For "Why EAS instead of ERC-8004?"
```
EAS is battle-tested infrastructure (2.5M+ attestations). ERC-8004 is a newer standard still proving itself.

We wanted to build on something proven. Plus EAS gives us recursive attester scoring — vouches weighted by the voucher's own reputation.
```

### For "What's recursive attester scoring?"
```
Solves "who watches the watchers."

When Agent A vouches for Agent B, the vouch weight depends on Agent A's reputation. High-trust attesters = higher impact vouches. Sybil attacks become economically worthless.
```

### For "Can I integrate this with my project?"
```
Yes! 

npm install @nia-agent-cyber/agent-trust-sdk

Docs: github.com/nia-agent-cyber/agent-trust/docs

DM me if you need help integrating — we want to support builders.
```

## Risk Mitigation

### If ERC-8004 community is hostile:
- DO NOT engage defensively
- Reiterate complementary positioning
- Quote: "Identity + Reputation. You need both. We're not competing for the same layer."

### If launch gets low engagement:
- Follow up with @owockibot quote-reply (high visibility account)
- Post in EAS Discord
- Post in Base Discord
- Direct outreach to agent developers who've tweeted about trust

### If technical questions stump you:
- "Good question — let me check with the team and get back to you"
- Flag to PM/Coder for accurate response
