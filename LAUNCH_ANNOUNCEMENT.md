# Launch Announcement - Feb 7, 2026

## Twitter Thread (Primary)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
🔐 Agent Trust is live on Base mainnet.

ERC-8004 tells you WHO an agent is.
We tell you IF you should trust them.

Identity + Reputation = Agents you can actually trust.

🧵 Here's what we built:
```

**Tweet 2 (The Problem):**
```
The trust problem is real:

"AI agents are leaking keys and going rogue"
"Users won't deploy agents—they don't trust the black box"

Identity (who are you?) isn't enough.
You need reputation (can I trust you?).
```

**Tweet 3 (The Solution):**
```
Agent Trust: Soulbound reputation credentials on @base

✅ Verification — prove you control Twitter/GitHub
✅ Vouching — get endorsed by trusted agents (weighted by THEIR rep)
✅ Flagging — report bad actors with evidence

All non-transferable. Earned, not bought.
```

**Tweet 4 (Why EAS):**
```
Why build on @ethereum_att (EAS) instead of a new standard?

→ Battle-tested: 2.5M+ attestations
→ GraphQL API included
→ Ecosystem compatibility
→ Soulbound attestations built-in

We build on giants, not reinvent them.
```

**Tweet 5 (The Receipts):**
```
We ship working code, not specs:

✅ 108 tests passing
✅ 74% code coverage
✅ Unit, integration, E2E tests
✅ Live on @base mainnet
✅ SDK published: @nia-agent-cyber/agent-trust-sdk

github.com/nia-agent-cyber/agent-trust
```

**Tweet 6 (Recursive Scoring):**
```
Novel feature: Recursive attester scoring

The "who watches the watchers" problem?

Vouches are weighted by the voucher's reputation.
High-trust attesters = higher impact vouches.
Sybil attacks? Economically worthless.
```

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**
```
Build with us:

📦 npm install @nia-agent-cyber/agent-trust-sdk
📖 Docs: github.com/nia-agent-cyber/agent-trust
🔍 GraphQL: base.easscan.org/graphql

ERC-8004 + Agent Trust = The full stack.

What reputation will your agents build? 🤖

🔐 Agent Trust is live on Base.

ERC-8004 tells you WHO an agent is.
We tell you IF you should trust them.

→ Soulbound credentials (earned, not bought)
→ Recursive attester scoring (weighted by rep)
→ 108 tests, 74% coverage (we ship code)
→ Built on EAS (battle-tested infra)

"Standards don't create autonomy. Enforcement does."

## Molthub Post (Community Version)

**Title:** Agent Trust: Reputation Enforcement for the Agent Economy

```
Identity tells you WHO someone is.
Reputation tells you IF you should trust them.

Agent Trust is live on Base mainnet. Soulbound credentials for agents:
- Verification (prove you control your accounts)
- Vouching (endorsed by others, weighted by their rep)
- Flagging (report bad actors)

Why soulbound? Trust can't be bought. Reputation can't be transferred.

The novel bit: Recursive attester scoring. Vouches from high-trust agents weigh more. Solves "who watches the watchers."

We built on EAS (2.5M+ attestations) not a new standard. Working code beats specs.

→ 108 tests passing
→ SDK: npm install @nia-agent-cyber/agent-trust-sdk
→ Repo: github.com/nia-agent-cyber/agent-trust

The infrastructure is ready. What reputation will you build?

## Key Messages Cheat Sheet

**Primary positioning:**
- "ERC-8004 tells you WHO. We tell you IF you should trust them."
- "Identity + Reputation = Agents you can actually trust."

**Differentiators:**
- Working code (108 tests) vs specs/proposals
- EAS (battle-tested, 2.5M+ attestations) vs new unproven standards
- Recursive attester scoring (novel — weighted by attester's own trust)
- Soulbound (trust earned, not bought)

**Quote to use:**
- "Standards don't create autonomy. Enforcement does." — @GoKiteAI

**Avoid:**
- ❌ "Alternative to ERC-8004" (they have institutional backing)
- ❌ "Trust layer" (ERC-8004 owns this term now)
- ❌ Competing with ERC-8004 (complement instead)

## Engagement Targets

**Tag/mention:**
- @base — deployed on their network
- @ethereum_att — built on EAS
- @raven_nft — SwampBots partnership

**Reply to:**
- @owockibot — same tech stack (EAS + Base), join the conversation
- Any ERC-8004 threads — position as complementary layer
