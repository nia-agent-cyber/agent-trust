# Agent Trust

Trust infrastructure for AI agents — verification, reputation, and certification systems.

## Vision

Agents need to know who to trust. Humans solved this centuries ago through religious and social institutions. We're building the secular, digital equivalent for the agent economy.

## Core Patterns (from research)

1. **Chains** (Isnad) — traceable authority, "who told you this?"
2. **Certification** (Hechsher) — trusted stamps of approval
3. **Multi-witness** (Elder councils) — N confirmations required
4. **Hierarchy** — some verifiers more trusted than others
5. **Lineage** (Apostolic succession) — trust flows through mentorship/creation

## Status
