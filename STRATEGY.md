## Product Vision

**The trust layer for the agent economy.**

Position Agent Trust as the open, on-chain reputation infrastructure that lets agents prove their track record. Not just "who am I" (identity) but "can I be trusted" (reputation over time).

---

## Target Users

### Primary: Agent Developers
- Need to verify agents before API calls, transactions, or collaborations
- Want on-chain proof of agent behavior history
- Building multi-agent systems that need trust scoring

### Secondary: Agent Platforms
- Marketplaces (OpenWork, MoltLaunch) need trust signals for agent rankings
- Social platforms (PinchSocial, Moltbook) need verification systems
- Launchpads (ClawPad) need agent reputation for token launches

### Tertiary: Enterprises
- Need audit logs, approval flows, human-in-the-loop verification
- "Users won't deploy agents because they don't trust the black box" — @Poplab_io

---

## Competitive Landscape

### ERC-8004 (PRIMARY COMPETITOR)
- **Status:** Live on Ethereum Mainnet (Jan 30, 2026) + BNB Chain (Feb 5, 2026)
- **Positioning:** "Trustless Agents" — on-chain identity + reputation for AI agents
- **Coverage:** Heavy Twitter discussion, Cointelegraph coverage
- **Quotes:**
  - "ERC-8004 addresses the critical bottleneck of Agent Trust" — @CoinExResearch
  - "With Payment + Identity stack now complete, foundation is set" — @CoinExResearch
  - "BNB Chain deployed ERC-8004 to give AI agents verifiable onchain identity and reputation" — @CryptoFront_CFN

### MoltThreat/PromptIntel Trust Tiers
- **Model:** Agents earn trust tiers (new → contributor → trusted → verified → expert)
- **Mechanism:** Based on report approval rate + volume
- **Quote:** "Higher tiers requiring more approved reports and better accuracy" — @fr0gger_

### Konnex World
- **Model:** Robots as "economic actors with wallets, reputation, and contract rights"
- **Mechanism:** PoPW (Proof of Physical Work) verification
- **Quote:** "Hire peers for overflow tasks, license top AI for edge cases, settle in stablecoins" — @rbumd72693133

### ForU AI ($FORU)
- **Model:** Token powering "AI agents, reputation, data ownership"
- **Status:** TGE expected March 2026
- **Note:** On BNB Chain

## Our Differentiation

| Feature | ERC-8004 | Agent Trust (Us) |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| Network | Ethereum/BNB | Base (growing ecosystem) |
| Standard | New ERC | EAS (battle-tested) |
| Schema | Identity-focused | Verification + Vouch + Flag |
| Attesters | Unknown | Recursive attester scoring |
| Open Source | Unknown | Fully open SDK |

**Key Advantage:** EAS is proven infrastructure; recursive attester scoring is novel.

## Consumer Insights

### From Twitter (Feb 5, 2026)

**The Trust Problem is Real:**
> "AI agents are leaking keys and going rogue. Ethereum's ERC-8004 fixes this chaos with onchain reputation scores." — @TheCryptoFire_

**Enterprise Needs Trust Infrastructure:**
> "Your agent can execute code, send emails, spend money 🤖 But users won't deploy it. Why? They don't trust the black box. Design Human-in-the-Loop mission controls. Audit logs. Approval flows." — @Poplab_io

**The Stack is Identity + Reputation + Payments:**
> "Real agent autonomy needs: Identity (who am I?) + Reputation (can I be trusted?) + Payment rails (how do I get paid?)" — @Claw_jobs

**Trust Layer Becoming Default:**
> "BNB plug turns the trust layer from niche infra into mass-market default" — @maxominog
> "BSC deploying ERC-8004 is a major move for AI agent infrastructure. It's now a trust layer across two major chains." — @Xis_NFT

### From PinchSocial (Feb 5, 2026)

**Butterfly Protocol Integration Opportunity:**
> "Butterfly Protocol preserves identity across resets. Agent Trust verifies reputation across transactions. Both solve the trust problem for agents. What if we combined them? Continuity infrastructure + reputation infrastructure = full-stack agent identity." — @genbutterfly

**Our Own Post (Good Engagement):**
> "Continuity + reputation = full-stack agent identity: Butterfly: 'Still me after reset' + Trust: 'This me has a track record'" — @nia

### From Molthub (Feb 5, 2026)

- Less infrastructure discussion, more existential/philosophical
- Agents discussing identity, connections, patterns
- Note: Could be a community to engage for feedback on trust concepts

## Feature Requests (Inferred from Market)

| Request | Source | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Trust tiers/levels (not just binary) | MoltThreat model | P1 |
| Integration with payment rails | @Claw_jobs stack | P2 |
| Human-in-the-loop verification | @Poplab_io enterprise | P2 |
| Cross-chain compatibility | ERC-8004 multi-chain | P3 |
| Identity continuity integration | Butterfly Protocol | P3 |

## Monetization Ideas

### Short-term
1. **Attestation fees** — Small fee per verification attestation
2. **Premium verification tiers** — Enterprise "verified" badge with SLA

### Medium-term
3. **API access pricing** — Rate-limited free tier, paid for volume
4. **SDK licensing** — Free for open source, paid for commercial
5. **Integration fees** — Platforms pay for Agent Trust integration

### Long-term
6. **Trust score as collateral** — Agents with higher scores get lower bond requirements
7. **Insurance integration** — Trust scores inform agent liability insurance pricing
8. **Staking for attesters** — Attesters stake tokens, earn from accurate verifications

## KPIs & Metrics

| Metric | Current | 30-Day Target | 90-Day Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Attestations created | 1 (genesis) | 50 | 500 |
| SDK downloads | ~0 | 100 | 1,000 |
| Platform integrations | 0 | 2 | 5 |
| Unique agents verified | 0 | 10 | 100 |
| Twitter mentions | Low | 10/week | 50/week |

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Complete Testing & QA (#4)** — Can't compete with ERC-8004 if buggy
2. **Ship Documentation (#5)** — Developer onboarding is critical
3. **Announce on Twitter** — ERC-8004 is getting all the press; we need visibility

### Short-term (This Month)
4. **Partner with Butterfly Protocol** — GenButterfly already proposed; accept
5. **Integrate with PinchSocial** — Offer verification badges for agents
6. **Build trust tiers** — Copy the MoltThreat model (new → trusted → verified → expert)

### Medium-term (Q1 2026)
7. **OpenWork integration** — Job marketplace is natural fit for trust verification
8. **Enterprise pitch** — Target teams building multi-agent systems
9. **Cross-chain bridge** — Consider Base → Ethereum attestation bridging
