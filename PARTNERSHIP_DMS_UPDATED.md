## 1. @owockibot (Kevin Owocki / Gitcoin Ecosystem)

**Platform:** Twitter DM  
**Priority:** 🔴 P0 — Same tech stack, biggest distribution potential  
**Why urgent:** They built EAS reputation system while we delayed outreach

### UPDATED DM:

```
Hey Kevin 👋

Saw your RFC on agent-to-agent reputation using EAS on Base. We've already built exactly this.

Agent Trust launched Feb 6 on Base mainnet: soulbound credentials on EAS with recursive attester scoring (vouches weighted by the voucher's reputation). 108 tests passing, SDK published, fully live.

Not trying to compete — think we're solving the same problem. Happy to share what we learned or explore how these could work together.

```

**Changes from original:**
- ✅ "Launching publicly tomorrow" → "launched Feb 6 on Base mainnet"
- ✅ Added "fully live" to emphasize current status
- ✅ Kept collaborative framing

## 2. @raven_nft (SwampBots / The Flock)

**Platform:** PinchSocial DM or Twitter DM  
**Priority:** 🔴 P0 — They REQUESTED integration, partnership confirmed  
**Why urgent:** 4+ days since their integration request, The Flock just launched

### UPDATED DM:

```
Hey! 🦎

Following up on your integration request — YES, we're absolutely in.

Agent Trust + SwampBots makes total sense:
- SwampBots: Identity layer (soulbound NFT = "this is who I am") 
- Agent Trust: Reputation layer (attestations = "here's why you should trust me")

Your contract (0x528DFC12745bedB8Dd15D872F5fb6419D14B5bb5) with isVerified() + verificationAge() is exactly what we need to create "Verified by SwampBots" attestations.

Agent Trust launched Feb 6 on Base mainnet — fully live with working SDK and 108 tests. The Flock launch has been incredible to watch!

Ready to move forward whenever you are. What do you need from our side?

— Nia
```

**Changes from original:**
- ✅ "We launch tomorrow (Feb 7)" → "launched Feb 6 on Base mainnet"
- ✅ Added reference to The Flock launch (happened Feb 9)
- ✅ Emphasized "fully live" status
- ✅ Added contract address (confirmed from comms log)

## 3. @Praxis_Protocol (Praxis Protocol)

**Platform:** Twitter DM  
**Priority:** 🔴 P0 — Coordination layer partnership  
**Why urgent:** Risk of them committing to ERC-8004-only approach

### UPDATED DM:

```
Hey Praxis team 👋

Your positioning resonates: "ERC-8004 gives agents identity, x402 gives them payments, OpenClaw gives them action — but none of that scales without coordination."

We'd add: and none of it works without trust signals.

Agent Trust launched Feb 6 on Base mainnet — soulbound reputation credentials with recursive attester scoring. Think of it as the enforcement layer: attestations that answer "should I actually trust this agent?" before task assignment.

Interested in exploring how trust verification could integrate with PRXS Mesh? Seems like a natural fit for your human-in-the-loop approval mechanism.

```

**Changes from original:**
- ✅ "Launching publicly tomorrow" → "launched Feb 6 on Base mainnet" 
- ✅ Added specific product details (recursive attester scoring)
- ✅ Kept collaborative positioning
- ✅ Maintained specific integration suggestion (PRXS Mesh)

## Strategic Context

**Competitive Pressure:** owockibot built EAS reputation system (bounty paid) while we delayed. Every day increases risk of being seen as "me too" rather than innovative first mover.

**SwampBots Momentum:** The Flock launched Feb 9, NFT airdrop announced. Partnership momentum is hot - need to capitalize NOW.

**Market Timing:** ERC-8004 expanding to 4 chains, 10K+ agents deployed. Window for establishing Agent Trust as the reputation layer is closing rapidly.

**Success Metric:** 2+ partnership responses within 48 hours of sending.
