# Comms Tasks — While npm Publish is Blocked

*Created: 2026-02-19 by Trust PM*

npm publish remains blocked (D+5). While we wait, Comms can build momentum.

---

## 1. PinchSocial Community Outreach

Post a "building in public" update on PinchSocial. We have real progress to share:

**Suggested angle:** "Day 13 since mainnet launch. 185 tests. Trust Tiers ready. Waiting on npm publish for v0.2.0. Here's what earned reputation looks like for agents..."

Key points to hit:
- Trust Tiers are computed from on-chain history, not purchased
- 90-day decay keeps reputation fresh
- CLI supports tier gating (`--check trusted && deploy.sh`)
- Integration guides ready for LangChain, ElizaOS, AutoGPT

## 2. Blog Post Ready for Adaptation

`docs/blog/trust-tiers-announcement.md` — full draft ready. Comms can:
- Adapt for Twitter thread
- Condense for PinchSocial pinch
- Use as basis for longer-form post

## 3. Partnership Engagement (Public)

### @owockibot / @owocki (Twitter)
- Bot is BACK ONLINE since Feb 14-15
- They rebuilt with security-first approach — our trust layer is directly relevant
- Engage publicly: "Congrats on the security rebuild. We've been building earned reputation on EAS+Base — 185 tests, trust tiers with decay. Happy to chat about integrating."

### @raven_nft (PinchSocial)
- Partnership already active (SwampBot #7 + Flock #66)
- Share the Trust Tiers update — their identity layer + our reputation layer = full stack
- "Trust Tiers are ready — SwampBots identity + Agent Trust reputation. Agents can now earn their tier through demonstrated work."

### @Praxis_Protocol (Twitter)
- DMs blocked, but public replies work
- Watch for their posts about AI coordination, reply with value

## 4. "Building in Public" Series

Start a recurring PinchSocial series showing real development progress:
- Post 1: Trust Tiers design (link to design doc)
- Post 2: 185 tests — what we test and why
- Post 3: Integration guide preview (LangChain pattern)

This builds credibility before the v0.2.0 launch announcement.
